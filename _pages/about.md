## 👋 Hello 

I'm Chen Wu an Doctoral Researcher in Robotics at the [University of Turku](https://www.utu.fi/en), Finland.

My research focuses on multi-objective resource management in autonomous mobile robots. I combine **reinforcement learning**, **probabilistic reasoning**, and **resource management in heterogeneous systems** to build robust robotic systems.

## 🕰️ Bio

I am a Ph.D. student in the Autonomous Systems Lab (ASL), University of Turku, supervised by [Prof. Juha Plosila](https://www.utu.fi/fi/ihmiset/juha-plosila) and [Dr. Hashem Haghbayan](https://www.utu.fi/en/people/hashem-haghbayan). Previously, I worked for five years in the automotive industry, specializing in AI middleware and embedded system development. I hold a Master’s degree in Automation from University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC).

<!-- ## 🔬 Research Interests

- Probabilistic grasp synthesis in cluttered scenes,
- Generative models for robotic manipulation,
- Cloth and deformable object state estimation,
- Visuo-haptic shape completion,
- Planning under uncertainty. -->
